heapdemo code shows how the pairing heap works. UI:
- Starts with the '0' node inserted, and the list of nodes goes from 0 to 127.
- x -> reset the heap, and the list of nodes to insert
- spacebar -> insert the next node
- r -> randomize the list of nodes to insert, and reset
- b -> randomize the remaining list of nodes
- o -> sort back to the original 0 .. 127 list, and reset
- i -> sort 127 .. 0 and reset
